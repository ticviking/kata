# FizzBuzz in F#

FizzBuzz is a common programming exercise.
Derived from a child's game to practice multiplication and division the rules of fizz buzz are:

>   The group counts up from 1, each taking a turn saying the next number. 
>   When it is your turn say the current number, unless one of the below rules applies.
>    If that number is 3 or a multiple of 3, do not say the number, say "Fizz".
>    If that number is 5 or a multiple of 5, do not say the number, say "Buzz".

The FizzBuzz module plays this game, given a number it outputs the correct thing for a player to say on that number.

The goal of this kata is to practice tool use, the code problem is as small and simple as possible to make issues in my tools and approach the pain points.
