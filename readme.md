# The Kata Repo

A place to build the same thing over and over again to practice the rote skills of being a dev.


This repo changes a lot, though the HEAD of master should usually be my latest kata run. There will be several branches of kata runs kept alive until I feel I have perfected the kata.

## TODO:

- [ ] Commit-hooks to update readme with kata info and run stats.
- [ ] Gather per-commit stats
- [ ] Something to make it easy for someone to fork and create their own base kata setup.
